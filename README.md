# Convex-Visualization

An animation that shows visually if the condition for a function to be a convex function is satisfied. Works with any continuous functions, and between any two points chosen by the user.

The left side of the equation represents the function and the right side represents the line between the convex combination.
f(alpha*x1+(1-alpha)*x2)<=alpha*f(x1)+(1-alpha)f(x2), where 0<=alpha<=1
